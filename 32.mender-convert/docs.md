### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (2.6.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 2.5.0:

* configs/images/raspberrypi_raspbian_config: Allow APT Suite change
  ([MEN-5057](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-5057))

  `master`.

  "fw_setenv" have been renamed to "grub-mender-grubenv-print" and
  "grub-mender-grubenv-set", respectively. This has been done in order
  to avoid conflict with U-Boot's user space tools, which have the same
  names.
* RPi pre-converted images: remove Mender client version from
  Artifact name.
* Create symlink from `/var/lib/mender-monitor` to
  `/data/mender-configure`
  ([MEN-5086](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-5086))

### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (2.5.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 2.4.0:

* Switch to stable version of mender-configure.
* Always create symlinks from `/var/lib/mender-configure` to
  `/data/mender-configure`. They always need to installed in a
  rootfs-image prepared image, even if the software isn't, because if
  the package is installed later, the links must be present or it will
  act as if it is a non-rootfs image, and store the settings on the
  rootfs partition, when they should be stored on the data partition.
* Raspberry Pi: create symbolic links from /boot to /uboot for
  all existing files in boot partition. Some Raspberry Pi apps, like Pi
  Camera, expect firmware files at /boot.
  ([MEN-4658](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4658))
* Added an option `MENDER_CLIENT_INSTALL=y/n`, in order to
  configure the installation of the Mender client into the converted image.
  Defaults to `yes`.
  ([MEN-4256](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4256))
* Add a demo configuration in configs/mender_convert_demo_config which
  when added at run time creates a Mender demo setup in the converted image. This
  includes short polling intervals, and all add-on's installed by default.
  ([MEN-4462](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4462))
