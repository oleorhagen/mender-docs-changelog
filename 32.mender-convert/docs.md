### Changelogs

#### mender-convert (2.4.0)

New changes in mender-convert since 2.3.0:

* Set mender-connect version to latest
([MEN-4200](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4200))
* Support installing mender-configure addon. Not installed by
default, it can be configured using MENDER_ADDON_CONFIGURE_INSTALL and
MENDER_ADDON_CONFIGURE_VERSION variables.
([MEN-4422](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4422))
* Set mender-configure version to master
([MEN-4422](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4422))
* The standard RasperryPi configuration now comes with UBoot 2020.01 as
the default. ([MEN-4395](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4395))
* raspberrypi_config: Modify headless configuration services to
expect boot partition in /uboot instead of /boot.
([MEN-4117](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4117))
* [raspberrypi_config] Enable UART in U-Boot config.txt
([MEN-4567](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-4567))
* Update mender-artifact to 3.5.x.
* Switch to stable version of mender-configure.
* Always create symlinks from `/var/lib/mender-configure` to
`/data/mender-configure`. They always need to installed in a
rootfs-image prepared image, even if the software isn't, because if
the package is installed later, the links must be present or it will
act as if it is a non-rootfs image, and store the settings on the
rootfs partition, when they should be stored on the data partition.

* Add support for Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* Make sure artifacts are owned by same user as the launch directory.
* Changed the calculation of occupied space on the rootfs
partition to a more accurate formula.
* Add support for controlling rootfs size with `IMAGE_*` variables.
* `IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE` - The base size of the rootfs. The other two
variables modify this value
* `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SIZE` - The amount of free space to add to the
base size of the rootfs
* `IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR` - Factor determining the amount of free
space to add to the base size of the rootfs
The final size will be the largest of the two calculations. Please see
the `mender_convert_config` file comments for more information.
* Add lzma compression option for `MENDER_COMPRESS_DISK_IMAGE`.
* Bump mender-artifact version to 3.2.1.
* Turn off default ext4 filesystem feature `metadata_csum`.
This feature is not supported by tools on Ubuntu 16.04.
* Change the output filename naming scheme to mender.img
([MEN-3051](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3051))
* mender-convert: Rename variables for consistency with meta-mender.
* Fix certain kernels hanging on boot. In particular, recent
versions of Debian for Beaglebone was affected, but several other
boards using UEFI may also have been affected.
* Make device_type specific to each Raspberry Pi model.
([MEN-3165](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3165))
* Switch to Mender 2.3.0b1 components.

* Update mender-convert to use Mender final release v2.1.0

New changes in mender-convert since 1.1.1:

* Expand existing environment '$PATH' variable instead of replacing it
* Use same environment '$PATH' variable when using sudo
* Fail the docker build when mandatory build-arg 'mender_client_version' is not set.
* Update Dockerfile to use latest stable mender-artifact, v2.4.0
* Use mender-artfact v3. Requires rebuild of device-image-shell container.
